--------
Overview
--------
**XenonPy** is a Python library that implements a comprehensive set of machine learning tools
for materials informatics. Its functionalities partially depend on Python (PyTorch) and R (MXNet).
The current release (v0.2.1, 2019/2/20) is a prototype version, which provides some limited modules:

* Interface to the public materials database
* Library of materials descriptors (compositional/structural descriptors)
* Pretrained model library **XenonPy.MDL** (v0.1.0b, 2018/12/25: more than 10,000 models in 35 properties of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic compounds)
* Machine learning tools.
* Transfer learning using the pre-trained models in XenonPy.MDL

Features
--------
XenonPy has a rich set of tools for various materials informatics applications.
The descriptor generator class can calculate several types of numeric descriptors from ``compositional``, ``structure``.
By using XenonPy's built-in visualization functions, the relationships between descriptors and target properties can be easily shown in a heatmap.

Transfer learning is an important tool for the efficient application of machine learning methods to materials informatics.
To facilitate the widespread use of transfer learning,
we have developed a comprehensive library of pre-trained models, called **XenonPy.MDL**.
This library provides a simple API that allows users to fetch the models via an HTTP request.
For the ease of using the pre-trained models, some useful functions are also provided.
