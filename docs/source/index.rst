--------
Overview
--------
**XenonPy** is a Python library that implements a comprehensive set of machine learning tools
for materials informatics. Its functionalities partially depend on Python (PyTorch) and R (MXNet).
This package still under hard working. The current release provides some limited features:

* Interface to the public materials database
* Library of materials descriptors (compositional/structural descriptors)
* pre-trained model library **XenonPy.MDL** (v0.1.0.beta, 2019/8/9: more than 140,000 models (include private models) in 35 properties of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic compounds) [Currently under maintenance, expected to be recovered in v0.7]
* Machine learning tools.
* Transfer learning using the pre-trained models in XenonPy.MDL

Features
--------
XenonPy has a rich set of tools for various materials informatics applications.
The descriptor generator class can calculate several types of numeric descriptors from ``compositional``, ``structure``.
By using XenonPy's built-in visualization functions, the relationships between descriptors and target properties can be easily shown in a heatmap.

Transfer learning is an important tool for the efficient application of machine learning methods to materials informatics.
To facilitate the widespread use of transfer learning,
we have developed a comprehensive library of pre-trained models, called **XenonPy.MDL**.
This library provides a simple API that allows users to fetch the models via an HTTP request.
For the ease of using the pre-trained models, some useful functions are also provided.
