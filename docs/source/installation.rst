============
Installation
============

XenonPy can be installed using pip_ in Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 on Mac, Linux and Windows.
Alternatively, we recommend using the `Docker Image`_ if you have no installation preference.

We have no plan to support Python 2.x. One of the main reasons is that the ``pymatgen`` library will not support Python 2 from 2019.
See `this link <http://pymatgen.org/#py3k-only-with-effect-from-2019-1-1>`_ for details.

Also, note that XenonPy uses PyTorch_ to accelerate the neural network model training.
If you install XenonPy with PyTorch in windows os, additional tools will be needed.
We highly recommend you to install the `Visual C++ Build Tools <http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools>`_ before installing our packages.
Through the installation screen of Visual C++ Build Tools, you need to check the **windows 8.1 / 10 SDK options**.


.. _install_xenonpy:

---------
Using pip
---------

pip is a package management system for installing and updating Python packages,
which comes with any Python installation. On Ubuntu and Fedora Linux,
please use the system package manager to install the ``python3-pip`` package.
We suggest you to `upgrade pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ before using it to install other packages.

Before installing XenonPy, You need to install the peer dependencies PyTorch, pymatgen and rdkit_ first.
The easiest way to install all 3 packages is to use conda_.
The following official tutorials will guide you through a successful installation.

PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
:raw-html:`<br />`
pymatgen: http://pymatgen.org/index.html#getting-pymatgen
:raw-html:`<br />`
rdkit: https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html

When you reach this point, the remaining steps are very simple.
The following command will install XenonPy in your default python environment.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install xenonpy

Users can use the following command to install the package at a user-specified directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install xenonpy --user

The pre-installed version could be updated to the latest stable release as follow.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install --upgrade xenonpy


------------
Using docker
------------

.. image:: _static/docker.png


Docker is a tool designed to easily create, deploy, and run applications across multiple platforms using containers.
Containers allow a developer to pack up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, into a single package.
We provide the `official docker images`_ via the `Docker hub <https://hub.docker.com>`_.

If you have not installed Docker yet, follow the `official installation tutorial <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_ to install docker CE on your machine.
Once your docker installation is done, use the following command to boot up XenonPy with jupyterlab_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run --rm -it -v $HOME/.xenonpy:/home/user/.xenonpy -v <path/to/your/work_space>:/workspace -p 8888:8888 yoshidalab/xenonpy

Then, open http://localhost:8888 from your favourite browser.


------------------------------
Installing in development mode
------------------------------

To use the latest development version distributed at `Github repository`_,
just clone the repository to create a local copy:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/yoshida-lab/XenonPy.git

under the cloned folder, run the following to install XenonPy in development mode:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd XenonPy
    $ pip install -e .

To update XenonPy, use ``git fetch && git pull`` 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git fetch && git pull
