Transfer learning
=================

There are variety of methodologies for transfer learning such as **fine tuning** and **frozen feature extraction**.
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to do a **frozen feature extraction** transfer learning by using XenonPy.

This tutorial will use **Refractive Index** data which collected from `Polymer Genome <https://www.polymergenome.org>`_.
Due to permissions of Polymer Genome, we can't provide these data together with our package. If you wan to rerun this notbook locally, you must collect these data yourself.
