Transfer learning
=================

There are variety of methodologies for transfer learning, such as **fine tuning** and **frozen feature extraction**.
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to do a **frozen feature extraction** by using XenonPy.

This tutorial will use **Refractive Index** data collected from `Polymer Genome <https://www.polymergenome.org>`_.
Due to data sharing policy of Polymer Genome, we are not providing these data in our package. If you want to rerun this notebook locally, please collect these data yourself.
